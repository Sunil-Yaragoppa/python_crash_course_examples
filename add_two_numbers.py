'''Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. 
When you try to convert the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError. Write a program that prompts for two numbers. 
Add them together and print the result. Catch the ValueError if either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. 
Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a number.'''
